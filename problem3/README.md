# üõ†Ô∏è Refactoring Summary for WalletPage.tsx

This document outlines the 8 identified issues and their corresponding fixes in the original `WalletPage` component written in React with TypeScript.

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Breakdown

| Fix # | Location | Issue | Resolution |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| **FIX 1** | `WalletBalance` interface | ‚ùå The `blockchain` field was missing, causing `getPriority(balance.blockchain)` to break. | ‚úÖ Added `blockchain: string` to the `WalletBalance` interface. |
| **FIX 2** | `getPriority` function | ‚ùå Used `any` for `blockchain`, bypassing TypeScript type checking. | ‚úÖ Replaced `any` with `string` for strong type safety. |
| **FIX 3** | `useMemo ‚Üí .filter()` | ‚ùå Used an undefined variable `lhsPriority`, leading to runtime error. | ‚úÖ Corrected to `balancePriority` ‚Äî the correct variable name in scope. |
| **FIX 4** | `useMemo ‚Üí .filter()` | ‚ùå The filter logic allowed balances with `amount <= 0` and excluded valid ones. | ‚úÖ Updated condition to: `balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount > 0`. |
| **FIX 5** | `useMemo ‚Üí .sort()` | ‚ùå Redundant `if-else` logic for comparing priority values. | ‚úÖ Simplified with `return rightPriority - leftPriority`. |
| **FIX 6** | `formattedBalances` array | ‚ùå Created `formattedBalances` array but never used it. | ‚úÖ Marked it as safe to remove or moved formatting inline (see FIX 7). |
| **FIX 7** | `rows.map()` | ‚ùå Incorrectly accessed `.formatted` from `WalletBalance` which doesn't have that field. | ‚úÖ Used `balance.amount.toFixed()` inline to format the value directly. |
| **FIX 8** | `rows.map()` | ‚ùå Used unstable `key={index}` in list rendering, which can cause UI bugs. | ‚úÖ Replaced with stable `key={balance.currency}`. |

## ‚ú® Final Notes

- All TypeScript types are now strictly respected.
- Logic is cleaner and more performant.
- Rendering is stable, safe, and follows React best practices.
- The code is easier to maintain and debug going forward.
