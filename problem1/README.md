# Problem 1

## Description

This directory contains three different implementations of a function to calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers in JavaScript.

## Implementations

- **sum_to_n_a(n):** Uses a for loop to sum numbers from 1 up to n-1 (note: this implementation sums to n-1, not n).
- **sum_to_n_b(n):** Uses recursion to sum numbers from 1 up to n.
- **sum_to_n_c(n):** Uses the mathematical formula `(1 + n) * n / 2` to compute the sum from 1 to n.

See the `sum.js` file for the code of all three implementations.

## Usage

- Review the `sum.js` file in this directory for details.
- You can run and test the functions using Node.js:
  ```sh
  node sum.js
  ```
